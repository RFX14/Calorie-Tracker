# CalorieTracker
A simple calorie tracking app, that allows users to track their daily intake without the complicated options that modern apps provide.

**NOTE:** After cloning repo, unzip the zipped file before opening the project

This app allowed me to learn more about the following:
- Databases: Utilizing CoreData I was able to save a user's frequent foods
- SwiftUI: To make a visually pleasing progress bar SwiftUI allowed for the easy creation of a progress bar
- MVC Architechture: This was used to clearly organize my code and it's workflow
- UIKit: Allowed for the creation of the main user interface.
